# rufbus
Rota helper for calculation of required shift length when working on a 3/1 plus 6/3 rota instead of a 5/2 rota

Challenge description: Rufbus drivers working on a rota of 3 days on / 1 day off, then 6 days on / 3 days off, need to have their net shift length slightly extended in order to work the same hours as drivers working on the traditional 5 days on / 2 days off rota. The problem is the length of each cycle, as this rota gives 4 days off in 13 days, whereas the traditional rota gives 4 days off in 14 days, so there are more cycles and more days off in a full year. The longer shift time ensures that the negotiated tariff requirement of 40 hours (adjustable) per week is met.

The variable names and final output text are in German, as this was made for a German project, but the comments are in English for easy adaptation to other languages.
